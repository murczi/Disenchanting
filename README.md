# Introduction
Using this plugin you can remove enchantments from items and enchanted books onto other books to separate enchants.
This plugin was inspired by [Loikas](https://github.com/Loikas)'s [Expanded Enchants](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/expandedenchants.98780/) plugin.
# Config
The configuration is very simple:

- enabled -> Decide whether to enable or disable plugin on start
- shouldCostXp -> WIP
- xpCostPerLvl -> WIP
